This folder contains a template for a FMX Delphi application that includes auto-connection of ethernet, a Settings tab and the associated code handling to allow the user to set them.  It also includes persistant storage for the settings file and create an application folder to save files to.

Use Project Save As... to a new folder.
Open the form file and save it off as "FormXXXXXX.pas"
Object Inspector change the Name of the form to TXXXXXForm

This makes sure the filename and object names don't clash and weird compile problems start.
